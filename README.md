Anthropomorphization of Artificial Intelligence
===============================================

Artifical intelligence is becoming topic in scientific and more and more in
public space as well. From the beginning it is followed by questions which
outreach ordinary scientific discussion in terms of Kuhn's normal science. Is
creating of human-like artificial intelligence moral? Will it replace mankind?
Is existence of such being even possible if it has no soul? Should it have right
to vote? Most of this discussion is influenced by many effects from position of
science, religious stances or political goals and not last in the line
materiality of engineering work. On the second side it has no impact only in
scientific world, but also in its neighbourhood and whole society in forms of
law or in formulation of public fears or "power" struggle of science and
religion.

Topic is slightly researched by sociological, philosophical and juridical
literature. I'll try to show overview of sociologically relevant aspects of this
field. In opposite I'll not deal with topics which are clearly technical.
Methodologically it will be horizontal survey which is rooted in different
philosophical-sociological approaches from Bourdieu's theory of fields through
Latour's view on materiality to Habermas' theory of communication. Text
identifies four basic narratives of AI discourse (scientific, religious,
        securitization and artistic) with whose will be illustrating particular
topics.
